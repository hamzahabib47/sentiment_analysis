In the sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook, you will find the steps to do sentiment analysis on the amazon_fine_food_reviews dataset from kaggle.

First we will use SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from nltk library and then we will use transformers from hugging face library to
predict whether the review is good or bad.

At the end, we will compare the scores of both the model to see which model is giving better results.
